# REST: Representational State Transfer

REST, or Representational State Transfer, is an architectural style designed for networked applications. It utilizes a stateless, client-server, cacheable communications protocol, with the HTTP protocol being the most commonly used medium. REST is favored in web services development due to its straightforward approach and reliance on the existing infrastructure and capabilities of the internet's HTTP. This design choice allows REST to achieve its goals without the need for inventing new standards, frameworks, or technologies.

## Core Concepts of REST

The essence of REST revolves around **resources**, which are identified by URLs, and the **methods** defined by the HTTP protocol to interact with these resources. RESTful applications leverage HTTP requests to:

- **Post data** (create or update resources),
- **Read data** (e.g., execute queries), and
- **Delete data**,

effectively treating web services as a resource platform where create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations can be executed.
